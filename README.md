# 🧪 Master Thesis – No Reading Required: Using Gamified Eye-Tracking to Predict RAN Scores and Screen for Developmental Dyslexia

## 📚 Abstract
Eye-tracking combined with machine learning shows strong potential as a diagnostic
tool for developmental dyslexia, particularly when decoupled from reading-based
assessments. However, few studies have explored the use of gamified, non-reading tasks
suitable for pre-readers. This pilot study investigates whether eye-tracking metrics recorded
during gameplay (Fruit Ninja) can predict Rapid Automatized Naming scores and classify
individuals into “good” versus “poor” performance groups. A total of 23 eye-tracking features
were extracted from 57 participants (children and adults) and analysed using correlation,
regression, and classification models. Correlation and regression analyses identified several
significant predictors of Rapid Automatized Naming performance, particularly features
related to blink behaviours, saccade length, and gaze complexity, while classification models
yielded the highest accuracy with blink and fixation-based features. These findings suggest
that oculomotor behaviour during a non-reading task contains information relevant to
reading ability and may reflect magnocellular processing differences. This approach shows
promise for early, literacy-independent risk detection, but further research with larger and
clinically diverse samples is needed to validate and extend these results. 


## 🎯 Project Goals
- Train an object detection model capable of tracking fruits and bombs from scene video of FruitNinja
- Extract 23 eye-tracking features from data
- Build a machine learning pipeline to screen for dyslexia without reading-based tasks
- Evaluate feature importance with Random Forest Feature Importance Ranking
- Interpretable AI with SHAP analysis
- Correlate eye-tracking features to RAN score
- Predict RAN performance using regression/classification


## 🚀 Usage

This project is organized into 6 pipeline stages (`0` to `5`). Each folder contains scripts that must be run **in numerical order**. Most steps include both `.py` and `.ipynb` files. The only exception is the first step, which is intended to be run in **Google Colab**.

```bash
# Step 0: Object detection in Google Colab
# Run this notebook in Colab (not locally)
0_object_detection/0.1_yolov8_train.ipynb

# Steps 1–5: Run locally in order
# Each folder may contain multiple .py and .ipynb files

python 1_model_fine-tuning/*.py
python 2_data_sync/*.py
python 3_annotation_tools/*.py
python 4_data_preprocessing/*.py
jupyter notebook 4_data_preprocessing/*.ipynb
jupyter notebook 5_analysis/*.ipynb
```
Paths are managed in `utils.paths.py`
